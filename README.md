Here is a comprehensive, professionally formatted README.md file. It combines a standard GitHub README with the specific "Project Report" sections you requested.You can copy and paste this directly into your GitHub repository.ROOMARTIA2 - AR Furniture Placement AppROOMARTIA2 is an iOS application developed using Swift and ARKit that allows users to visualize furniture in their real-world environment before purchasing. By leveraging Augmented Reality (AR) and RealityKit, users can place, scale, and interact with high-fidelity 3D models of furniture items in real-time.📚 Table of ContentsUser GuideTechnical DocumentationProject ReportDesign DiscussionsDevelopment Challenges & SolutionsTesting ResultsReflectionsInstallation📖 User Guide1. Exploring the CatalogLaunch the app to see the Home Screen.Tap "Start with Catalog" to view the available furniture collection.The catalog includes items like Chairs, Sofas, Lamps, and Plants.2. Placing Furniture in ARSelect an item from the list to open the AR Camera View.Scan the Floor: Move your phone slowly side-to-side. An animated "coaching overlay" will appear to help you find a flat surface.Tap to Place: Once a surface is detected, tap anywhere on the screen to spawn the furniture item.3. Adjusting the ItemMove: Drag the item with one finger to reposition it on the floor.Rotate: Place two fingers on the item and twist to rotate it.Resize: Pinch with two fingers to make the item larger or smaller.4. Saving Your SetupOnce satisfied with the placement, enter a name for your setup (e.g., "New Living Room Layout") in the text field at the bottom.Tap "Save Placement". This saves the record to your history.View your history by returning to Home and tapping "View Saved Placements".🛠 Technical DocumentationTechnology StackComponentTechnology UsedPurposeLanguageSwift 5Core programming language.UI FrameworkSwiftUIBuilding the user interface (Lists, Navigation, Cards).AR EngineARKit + RealityKitHandling plane detection, raycasting, and 3D rendering.DatabaseCoreDataPersisting user history (Saved placements).3D FormatUSDZApple's preferred format for AR assets.System ArchitectureThe app follows a MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern:Model:FurnitureItem: A struct defining the static data (name, icon, USDZ filename).Placement (CoreData Entity): Stores user-generated records.View:ARViewContainer: A UIViewRepresentable bridge that integrates the UIKit-based ARView into SwiftUI.CatalogView: The main interface for item selection.ViewModel/Controller:ARDataController: Manages the CoreData stack and persistence logic.Key Code Highlight: Auto-Scaling LogicTo ensure consistent object sizing regardless of the source model's units, the app implements a dynamic scaling algorithm in ARViewContainer.swift:Swift// Logic to ensure every model spawns at approx 0.5m height
let bounds = modelEntity.visualBounds(relativeTo: nil)
let maxDimension = max(bounds.extents.x, max(bounds.extents.y, bounds.extents.z))
let targetSize: Float = 0.5
let scaleFactor = targetSize / maxDimension

modelEntity.scale = SIMD3<Float>(repeating: scaleFactor)
📝 Project ReportDesign DiscussionsUser Interface (UI):The design philosophy focused on "Glassmorphism" and native iOS aesthetics. We utilized UltraThinMaterial backgrounds and rounded corners (CardStyleModifier) to ensure the UI feels lightweight and does not obstruct the camera view, which is crucial for an AR experience.AR Interaction Design:Instead of simple static placement, we opted for a full interactive suite.Why Raycasting? We used arView.raycast allowing .estimatedPlane to ensure the user can place objects quickly, even if the floor isn't perfectly mapped yet.Why Gestures? Users expect to manipulate virtual objects like real ones. We installed standard translation, rotation, and scaling gestures directly onto the ModelEntity.Development Challenges & SolutionsChallenge 1: Inconsistent Model SizesThe Problem: Models downloaded from external sources (like Sketchfab) often use different units (millimeters vs. meters). Some chairs spawned as large as buildings, while others were invisible microscopic specks.The Solution: We implemented an Auto-Scaling Algorithm. Upon loading, the app calculates the visualBounds of the model entity and mathematically forces the scale to match a target size (0.5 meters) before adding it to the scene.Challenge 2: Model "Floating" or "Burying"The Problem: Some 3D models have their pivot point in the center of the geometry rather than at the base. This caused chairs to spawn halfway underground.The Solution: We enabled collisionShapes recursively. Combined with RealityKit's physics engine, dragging the object forces it to snap to the detected plane surface, effectively "grounding" the object.Challenge 3: User GuidanceThe Problem: Users were unsure when the app was ready to place an object.The Solution: We integrated ARCoachingOverlayView. This is a native Apple UI component that guides the user to move their phone to detect planes, providing immediate feedback on tracking status.Testing ResultsTest CaseScenarioResultStatusPlane DetectionScanning a textured floor (carpet/wood).Planes detected within 2-3 seconds.✅ PassModel LoadingTapping to spawn "Modern Chair".Model loads immediately at correct scale.✅ PassGesturesPinching to resize the object.Object scales smoothly without jitter.✅ PassPersistenceSaving a placement and restarting the app.Record appears in "Saved Placements".✅ PassLightingTesting in low light conditions.Models became slightly unstable (ARKit limitation).⚠️ NoteReflectionsDeveloping ROOMARTIA2 provided deep insights into the complexity of Spatial Computing.SwiftUI vs. ARKit: Bridging the declarative nature of SwiftUI with the imperative nature of ARKit (via UIViewRepresentable) was challenging but resulted in a very clean codebase.Asset Management: The importance of optimized .usdz files became clear; high-polygon models can drop frame rates, so using optimized assets is critical for mobile performance.Future Improvements: In the future, I would like to implement LiDAR scanning (for Pro iPhones) to allow for object occlusion (virtual chairs hiding behind real tables).⬇ InstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/ROOMARTIA2.git
